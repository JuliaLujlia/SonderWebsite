                        <p>The man walks through a busy avenue at sunset with benches. He is walking towards the camera.</p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>I wonder where he is now. Is he sleeping on that bench?</q></p>
                        <p>View of the promenade towards the city center. The man can be seen from behind as he walks along the path.</p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>Is he watching someone else? Five minutes ago, he was just a thief. A crazy guy.</q></p>
                        <p>View of a bridge over the river. People walking along the promenade.</p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>But he gave it back.</q></p>
                        <p>The man leans on the railing by the riverbank and looks at the water.</p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>Now… I can’t stop imagining his life. Maybe he had a job like mine once? Maybe...</q></p>
                        <p>A man and a woman are walking along the promenade and talking.</p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>He just fell through the cracks. </q></p>
                        <p>At the bottom of a set of stairs, two women are talking.</p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>Once you start wondering, you can’t stop.</q></p>
                        <p>The man is sitting on steps, holding a briefcase between his legs. His upper body is not visible.</p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>I see the surface. But underneath…</q></p>
                        <p>
                            Change of perspective. Now the man can be seen from behind, sitting on the steps and looking at the water. Other
                            people are sitting around him on the steps.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>There’s a whole ocean. I will never see.</q></p>
                        <p>Path further above the river. A couple moves toward the camera.</p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>That couple over there. Are they falling in love? O rare they saying goodbye.</q>
                        <p>
                            The man from behind, looking over a railing. View from below of his upper body. He is wearing headphones around
                            his neck.
                        </p></p>
                        <p>
                            A couple standing on the railing by the riverbank looking at the water, another couple with a dog running past
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <p>A man stands alone at the railing and looks at the water while other people walk by in the background.</p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>
                            And him. He looks exhausted. Just like me. Maybe he’s worried about a deadline or a diagnosis or a debt. It’s
                            deafening. Not the traffic.
                        </q></p>
                        <p>The man's feet can be seen as he walks</p>
                        <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                        <q>But… the thoughts inside his head.</q></p>

                        <p>
                            The same setting as the other days. The man walks toward the subway entrance wearing a coat, headphones, and
                            holding a cell phone in his hand.
                        </p>

                            it.
                        </q></p>
                        <p>He looks up. Puts his cell phone away, takes off his headphones, and runs down the stairs.</p>

Everyone is busy with their own script, their own panic, their own desire. But life is short, and it is wide—you just have to be brave enough to press pause.
