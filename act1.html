                            <p><strong>General Description:</strong> 
                            <h4>Act 1 Details</h4>
                            <p> This short film portrays a man in his thirties who is trapped in a monotonous urban everyday life. Through
                                repetition, visual isolation, and inner monologues, the film explores emotional numbness, alienation from other
                                people, and the consequences of living on autopilot. A life-changing encounter with a stranger forces the man to
                                slow down, reflect, and reconnect with the people and world around him.</p>
                                <h4>Characters</h4>
                                <p><strong>The man:</strong> Dressed in a corporate coat, emotionally drained.</p>
                                <h4>Act 1: The routine</h4>
                                <p> A man in his thirties stands at the top of a subway staircase on a cold day in the city. It is a grey day, which
                                emphasises the impersonal urban environment. He is wearing a business-style coat and looks physically well-groomed
                                but emotionally drained. He is wearing black noise-cancelling headphones and looking at his smartphone. His
                                posture is closed and withdrawn. He walks slowly and mechanically down the underground stairs.</p>

                                The man walks through a quiet subway station with escalators, glass railings, and a striking light installation
                                consisting of many warmly glowing light bulbs above the open area. The blue-tiled walls and cool lighting create a
                                businesslike, slightly distant atmosphere. He continues to look at his cell phone and takes the next escalator to
                                the platform. A stranger is standing in a corner of the station.

                                The man walks along the platform, scrolling through his phone. He looks at the timetable. He walks past other
                                passengers, but doesn't notice them. He sits down alone on a metal bench, puts his phone away, and waits
                                impatiently for the train. He looks alternately to the left and right. Even before the train arrives, he walks to
                                the edge of the platform.
