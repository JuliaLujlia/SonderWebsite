                            <h4>Location: Subway entrance</h4>
                            <p><em>♪ Monday, Monday by the Mamas & the Papas starts ♪</em></p>
                            <p>
                                The same scene as the day before. The man approaches the entrance to the underground station wearing headphones
                                and holding a mobile phone in his hand. As he takes his first step down, the stranger suddenly jumps out from the
                                side and snatches the mobile phone from him.The man cries out “Hey!” in shock and instinctively gives chase.
                            </p>
                            <h4>City streets, continuous action</h4>
                            <p><em>♪ Born of a Star by Izar starts ♪</em></p>
                            <p>
                                The chase takes place in the crowded streets of the city. The image blurs and distorts due to the movement,
                                reminiscent of stylized footprints. The city lights blur into lines. The man runs with his coat flapping,
                                breathing heavily and visibly panicked
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He weaves through the pedestrians, but the stranger catches up. He stops, gasping for air, and turns around. The
                                stranger has disappeared.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                            <q>I stood there. Gasping. My heart was hammering against my ribs. I felt … Ridiculous. So much noise</q></p>
                            <h4>Location: Habor</h4>
                            <p>The man is pensively walking along the promenade in a harbor. He is alone.</p>
                            <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong>
                            <q>
                                So much drama. It felt, Unnecessary. I hated it. I didn’t want to be there. I didn’t want to feel the cold. I
                                just … kept staring at the empty street. He was just there. And now… He’s gone
                            </q></p>
                            <p>He looks over the railing of a bridge and sees the stranger sitting on a bench below him.</p>
                            <p>
                                Close-up of the stranger sitting on the bench, smoking and scrolling through the man's cell phone. The man
                                approaches him, knocks the cigarette out of his hand, and grabs him by the collar, and addresses the stranger.
                            </p>
                            <p><em>♪ Music stops ♪</em></p>
                            <p><strong>The man:</strong> “Why did you run?”</p>
                            <p><strong>Stranger:</strong> “You looked like you were sleepwalking. You know I’ve been watching you.”</p>
                            <p><strong>The man:</strong> “Watching me?”</p>
                            <p><strong>Stranger:</strong> “Yes. I’ve been watching you. Every day. Same station. Looking at the same screen. And you never look up. Come sit down.”</p>
                            <p>
                                The stranger grabs his arm to urge him to sit down. The man sits down on the bench to the right of the stranger.
                                The stranger gives him back his cell phone.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Stranger:</strong> “Here. Let me tell you something. You know I used to be like you… Same suit. Same schedule. Same tunnel vision.”</p>
                            <p>The stranger lights a cigarette and starts smoking. close-up of the stranger</p>
                            <p><strong>Stranger:</strong> “You know I used to walk by this bench for 10 years and never saw it? Don’t wait until you lose everything to realize you were part of something bigger. Don’t be too late to notice.”</p>
                            <p>
                                The stranger looks into the camera. Then he stands up and leaves. Close-up of the man watching him leave. The
                                stranger stands on the shore and looks toward the water.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Stranger:</strong> “Go ahead and look. Take a look at the people.”</p>
                            <p>
                                The stranger leaves. The man now sits alone on the bench, looking at the water, thinking. He stands up and walks
                                out of the picture.

                            There is a sudden, sharp hunger that habit can no longer satisfy. It is the moment you realize that time is leaking through your fingers like neon light. The chase is not a run toward a destination, but a desperate sprint to catch up to a version of yourself that is still truly alive.
