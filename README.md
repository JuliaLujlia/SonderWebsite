This project is an accessible special website for the short film “Too Late To Notice.”

Every day, we pass hundreds of people - on the street, in the subway, in the constant rush of the city. Most of the time, we do not truly see them. They become part of the background, anonymous figures in a routine we follow without reflection.

The concept of Sonder describes the moment you realize that every stranger around you is living a life as complex, emotional, and meaningful as your own.

Our short film explores what happens when someone becomes trapped in isolation and routine. Moving through life on autopilot, disconnected from the world around him. An unexpected encounter interrupts this cycle and forces him to pause, look up, and finally notice.
