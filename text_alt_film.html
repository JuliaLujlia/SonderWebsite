    <h3>General description</h3>
    <p>
      This short film portrays a man in his thirties who is trapped in a monotonous urban everyday life. Through
      repetition, visual isolation, and inner monologues, the film explores emotional numbness, alienation from other
      people, and the consequences of living on autopilot. A life-changing encounter with a stranger forces the man to
      slow down, reflect, and reconnect with the people and world around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story is told through a combination of images, ambient city sounds, voice-over narration, and sparse dialogue.
      Lighting, framing, and editing rhythm play a central role in conveying mood and meaning.
    </p>
    <h3>Characters</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>The man (30s):</dt>
      <dd>
        Dressed in a corporate coat. He is handsome but looks drained. He exists in a self-imposed bubble of isolation.
      </dd>
      <dt>The stranger (40s-50s):</dt>
      <dd>Homeless. Wears layers. He is not a villain; he is a watcher.</dd>

    <h3>Act 1: The routine</h3>
    <h4>Location: Subway entrance</h4>
    <p>
      A man in his thirties stands at the top of a subway staircase on a cold day in the city. It is a grey day, which
      emphasises the impersonal urban environment. He is wearing a business-style coat and looks physically well-groomed
      but emotionally drained. He is wearing black noise-cancelling headphones and looking at his smartphone. His
      posture is closed and withdrawn. He walks slowly and mechanically down the underground stairs.

    </p>
    <p>
      The man walks through a quiet subway station with escalators, glass railings, and a striking light installation
      consisting of many warmly glowing light bulbs above the open area. The blue-tiled walls and cool lighting create a
      businesslike, slightly distant atmosphere. He continues to look at his cell phone and takes the next escalator to
      the platform. A stranger is standing in a corner of the station.
    </p>
    <h4>Location: Subway platform</h4>
    <p>
      The man walks along the platform, scrolling through his phone. He looks at the timetable. He walks past other
      passengers, but doesn't notice them. He sits down alone on a metal bench, puts his phone away, and waits
      impatiently for the train. He looks alternately to the left and right. Even before the train arrives, he walks to
      the edge of the platform.

    <h4>Location: The man's home</h4>
    <p>
      The man opens the door and the scene is illuminated by the light streaming into the apartment through the crack in
      the door. He enters, puts the key away, closes the door behind him, and it becomes dark.
    </p>
    <p><strong>displayed text</strong></p>
    <q>Staring at the door. Trying to remember if I spoke a single real word today.</q>
    <p>
      The man walks into the living room. He throws his briefcase onto the sofa. His headphones, his coat and he
      collapses onto the sofa. He takes off his dress shoes with his feet, with a close-up of the scene. He unbuttons
      his shirt. He looks tense, rubs his hands in front of his face, puts his head in his hands and rests his elbows on
      the table, runs his fingers through his hair and stands up
    </p>

      something, takes out a beer, stands up, and closes the refrigerator again.

      station, across the platform, waiting for the train, and walking home.

      The same scene as the day before. The man approaches the entrance to the underground station wearing headphones
      and holding a mobile phone in his hand. As he takes his first step down, the stranger suddenly jumps out from the
      side and snatches the mobile phone from him.The man cries out “Hey!” in shock and instinctively gives chase.

    <p>
      The chase takes place in the crowded streets of the city. The image blurs and distorts due to the movement,
      reminiscent of stylized footprints. The city lights blur into lines. The man runs with his coat flapping,
      breathing heavily and visibly panicked
    </p>
    <p>
      He weaves through the pedestrians, but the stranger catches up. He stops, gasping for air, and turns around. The
      stranger has disappeared.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Voice-over (the man):</strong></p>
    <q>I stood there. Gasping. My heart was hammering against my ribs. I felt … Ridiculous. So much noise</q>
