          <h2>TITLE: TOO LATE TO NOTICE</h2>
          <h3>CHARACTERS:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>THE MAN (30s): Dressed in a corporate coat. 
              He is handsome but looks drained. He exists in a self-imposed bubble of isolation.</li>
            <li>THE STRANGER (40s-50s): Homeless. Wears layers. 
              He is not a villain; he is a watcher.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>ACT 1: THE ROUTINE</h3>
          <p>EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE (STAIRS) - NIGHT <br>
          (The Anchor - Routine)<br>
          [VISUAL] The Man stands at the top of the concrete stairs. It is a standard, cold city night. Blue-tinted lighting.<br>
          He buttons his coat to his chin. He puts on large noise-canceling headphones. He stares at his phone screen.<br>
          He descends the stairs like a zombie. People brush past him, but he doesn't flinch. He is in a bubble. He is isolated from the sound of the city.<br>
          THE MAN (V.O.)<br>
          Do you believe in miracles? Or do you believe in cycles?<br>
          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT <br>
          (The Foreshadowing)<br>
          [VISUAL] The Man stands near the edge of the platform, waiting for the train. He is framed in the foreground, sharp focus, scrolling on his phone.<br>
          [BACKGROUND ACTION] Deep in the background, sitting on a metal bench, is THE STRANGER.<br>
          He is slightly out of focus (bokeh). While other commuters rush by in a blur, The Stranger is perfectly still. He is looking directly at The Man.<br>
          Note: The audience might miss him on the first watch, but he is there.<br>
          THE MAN (V.O.)<br>
          We spend our lives waiting. Waiting for the weekend. Waiting for the train. Waiting to feel something different.<br>
          INT. SUBWAY CAR / OFFICE / APARTMENT - NIGHT<br>
          (The Routine Montage)<br>
          [VISUAL] FAST CUTS. The editing accelerates to show the suffocating repetition.<br> </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>SUBWAY CAR: The Man sits. Reflection in the dark window.</li>
            <li>OFFICE: Typing at a desk in a dark room.</li>
            <li>APARTMENT: Entering. Throwing keys. Opening the fridge. Closing the fridge.</li>
            <li>REPEAT: Walking down the stairs (Day 2).</li>
            <li>REPEAT: Scrolling on the train (Day 3). (The Stranger is visible in the background again, sitting two rows back, watching).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>THE MAN (V.O.)<br>
            My life is a straight line. Point A to Point B. No detours. No surprises. Just the safety of the script.</p>
          <h3>ACT 2: THE CHANGE</h3>
          <p>EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE (STAIRS) - NIGHT<br>
          (The Anchor - The Incident)<br>
          [VISUAL] Same framing as Act 1. The Man approaches the stairs. Headphones on. Phone out.<br>
          He takes the first step down.<br>
          ACTION: THE STRANGER (the man from the background) lunges from the shadows. He snatches the phone from The Man’s hand.<br>
          THE MAN<br>
          Hey! Stop!<br>
          The Stranger sprints back up the stairs. The Man reacts—shock, then adrenaline. He scrambles up and chases.<br>
          EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS<br>
          (The Chase)<br>
          [VISUAL - STEP PRINTING]<br>
          The image blurs and streaks (Wong Kar-wai style). The Man is sprinting, coat flapping. The city lights smear into lines.<br>
          He is breathing heavy. Panic. Chaos.<br>
          He chases The Stranger through the streets, dodging pedestrians, but the gap widens.<br>
          He turns a corner onto a busy shopping street.<br>
          He pushes through the throng of people, searching desperately, but he is eventually swallowed by the crowd.<br>
          He stops. He spins around.<br>
          The Stranger is gone. Just a sea of anonymous backs.<br>
          THE MAN (V.O.)<br>
          And just like that... the screen went black.<br>
          EXT. PARK BENCH - LATER THAT NIGHT<br>
          (The Confrontation)<br>
          [VISUAL] A quiet, dark park.<br>
          The Man walks past a bench. He spots THE STRANGER sitting there, smoking a cigarette. The smoke swirls in the cold air. The phone sits on the bench next to him, untouched.<br>
          The Man approaches, out of breath, defeated.<br>
          THE MAN<br>
          Why... why did you make me run?<br>
          THE STRANGER<br>
          (Calmly, exhaling smoke)<br>
          Because you looked like you were sleepwalking. I've been watching you.<br>
          THE MAN<br>
          Watching me?<br>
          THE STRANGER<br>
          Every day. At the station. You stand in the same spot. You look at the same screen. You never look up.<br>
          The Man sits on the other end of the bench. He picks up his phone.<br>
          THE STRANGER<br>
          I used to be you. The suit. The schedule. The tunnel vision. I walked past this bench for ten years and never saw it.<br>
          (He leans in)<br>
          Don't wait until you lose everything to realize you were part of something bigger. Don't be too late to notice.<br>
          The Stranger stands up, dropping the cigarette and crushing it under his boot. He gestures toward the city center, where a warm, golden glow is rising.<br>
          THE STRANGER<br>
          Go. Take a walk. Really look at them.<br>
          He walks away into the shadows. </p>

          <h3>ACT 3: THE CHANGE (SONDER)</h3>
          <p>EXT. CHRISTMAS MARKET - MOMENTS LATER<br>
          (The Awakening)<br>
          [VISUAL] Drastic Color Shift.<br>
          The Man walks from the dark park into the Düsseldorf Christmas Market.<br>
          The screen is filled with GOLD, RED, and GREEN.<br>
          Fairy lights. Steam from Glühwein. Crowds.<br>
          The Man slows down. He looks around, stunned.<br>
          [VISUAL VFX - BLOB TRACKING / POV]<br>
          We switch to THE MAN'S POV. The camera tracks specific people. As it locks onto them, a simple, elegant text box tracks above their heads.<br>
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li>TARGET: A MAN holding a teddy bear.
          TEXT: "Buying this for his daughter. He hasn't seen her in a year."</li>
          <li>TARGET: A WOMAN laughing loudly.
          TEXT: "Just beat cancer. Celebrating being alive."</li>
          <li>TARGET: AN ELDERLY COUPLE sharing a crepe.
          TEXT: "Their 50th Christmas together."</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          [VISUAL] Cut back to The Man. He watches them. He isn't annoyed by the crowd anymore; he feels connected. A small smile forms.<br>
          THE MAN (V.O.)<br>
          Suddenly, the noise wasn't just noise. It was a symphony. Every stranger... a story.<br>
          EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE (STAIRS) - THE NEXT MORNING<br>
          (The New Routine)<br>
          [VISUAL] Bright Morning Light. The sun is breaking through the winter gray.<br>
          The Man stands at the exact same spot at the top of the stairs.<br>
          He is wearing his headphones. He is holding his phone. It looks like the loop is about to repeat.<br>
          ACTION: He pauses. He looks at the phone screen.<br>
          Then, slowly, deliberately:<br>
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li>He takes the headphones off his head.</li>
          <li>He slides the phone into his deep coat pocket.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          He takes a deep breath of the crisp morning air. He looks around at the city, taking it all in.<br>
          He steps forward and begins to walk down the stairs, head up, watching the people around him.<br>
          THE MAN (V.O.)<br>
          Life is short. But it is wide. You just have to be brave enough to press pause.<br>
          FADE TO BLACK.<br>
